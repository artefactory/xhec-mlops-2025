> [!Important]
> We will be using Docker for this course, which can use up a lot of your disk.
> Make sure to have at least 10Gb available in your disk before starting this course. Otherwise you risk running into some obscure errors.

> [!Note]
> Each section has a **Check your Installation** section.
> Please make sure you can run the commands in that section before moving on to the next section.

## How to debug

1. Check and try to understand your error message
2. ChatGPT it / Google it / StackOverflow it
3. If you can't find a solution, ask your friends
4. If your friends can't help you, ask us on Slack

## Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is a tool for MacOS and Windows machines for the building and sharing of containerized applications and microservices. It includes Docker Engine, Docker CLI client, Docker Compose, Notary, Kubernetes, and Credential Helper. It also features an intuitive user interface that makes managing your Docker images and containers locally much easier.

### Download and Install Docker Desktop

> [!Warning]
> ðŸ“£ **This step is the most time consuming one. You will not be able to perform it at HEC.** ðŸ“£

If you do not have `Docker Desktop` installed, you will need to install it. You can follow the official instructions:

- [Install Docker - Mac OS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
- [Install Docker - Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
- [Install Docker - Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

For those of you working on Windows, you might need to update Windows Subsystem for Linux. To do so, simply open PowerShell and run:

```bash
wsl --update
```

### Check your Installation - Docker Desktop

Once docker is installed, make sure that it is running correctly by running:

```bash
$ docker run -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
```

If you check the Docker App, you should see a 'getting started' container running. Once you've checked that this works correctly, remove the container via the UI.

<details>
    <summary><b>Optional</b></summary>
    You can also perform these operations directly from the command line, by running <code>docker ps</code> to check the running containers, <code>docker stop [CONTAINER-ID]</code> to stop it and <code>docker rm -f [CONTAINER-ID]</code> to remove it.
</details>


## Git


Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project at the same time without overwriting each other's changes.
It's essential for any collaborative coding project.

### Download & Install

To install Git, follow the instructions on the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
Choose the instructions that match your operating system.

After installation, you can verify that Git is correctly installed by opening a terminal and typing:

```bash
$ git --version
```

This should return the version of Git that you installed.

### Configure Git

After installing Git, you need to configure it with your name and email address.
This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it's immutably baked into the commits you start creating:

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "you email@foo.bar"
```

You can find full configuration instruction on the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).

<details>
  <summary>Windows only: <code>git bash</code></summary>

If you are using Windows, you can use PowerShell as your terminal.
But Powershell is limited and doesn't support all the commands we will use in this course.
You will need to install [`git bash`](https://gitforwindows.org/) to have access to all the commands we will use in this course.

Please carefully follow [instructions here](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.42.0.windows.2).

> [!Note]
> You can also use WSL terminal, but it's a bit more complicated to use.

</details>

### Check your Installation - Git

Open a terminal, you should be able to run the following commands:

```bash
$ git --version

```

Complete/check your setup with the following command (Type `:q` to exit):

```bash
$ git config --global --list
user.name=johndoe
user.email=johndoe@foo.bar
```

Try to reach pandas GitHub repo to check your connection to GitHub:

```bash
$ git ls-remote --get-url https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas.git
https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas.git
```

## Install requirements

> [!Warning]
> You will not have access to the course content before the course starts.
> So here is a sample requirements setup you should try before the course begins.

Follow these steps to set up your Python environment and install the required packages using `uv`. Be sure to have Python already installed.


1.  **Install `uv` globally (if not already present):**
    We recommend installing `uv` using `pipx` for a clean global installation, as done in our CI pipeline.
    ```bash
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    python -m pip install pipx && pipx ensurepath
    pipx install uv
    ```

2.  **Initialize Project Configuration:**
    Create an empty directory named `prerequisites` and initialize the configuration files using `uv init` inside it. This creates `pyproject.toml` and other necessary files.
    ```bash
    uv init
    ```

3.  **Add FastAPI Dependency:**
    Add the core web framework dependency using `uv add`. This updates both `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.
    ```bash
    uv add fastapi
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Synchronize the virtual environment to install all dependencies listed in the newly created/updated files.
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

5.  **Verify your installation:**
    Check that all packages are installed correctly (you should see `fastapi` in the list):
    ```bash
    uv pip list
    ```
    Then, open a Python shell to verify imports:
    ```bash
    uv run python
    >>> import fastapi
    >>> fastapi.__version__ # Should be something like '0.118.0'
    >>> exit()
    ```

If you see the correct version and no errors, your environment is ready!

Thank you âœ¨ !
